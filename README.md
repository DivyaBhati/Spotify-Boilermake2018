Spotify app

Spoilermake is a website that can make smarter song recommendations through the Spotify API and will analyze why each song was recommended, then SpoilerMake will be able to generate playlists with these recommended songs and well as generate a playlist based on filters you want to match the environment around you. In the Analyze function, the user will be able to input any URI and Spoilermake will return an analysis of what genres are present in either a playlist, song or artist page. In the Generate function, we ask the user for a playlist and in return we a playlist of similar genres and music taste but every song on the new playlist will not in be on the playlist that was given to the generate function. In the environment function, the website will present filters based on genres and some environments where music will be needed. Based on these filters, Spoilermake will return a playlist of user determined length
